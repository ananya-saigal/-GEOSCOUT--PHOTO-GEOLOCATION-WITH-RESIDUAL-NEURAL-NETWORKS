# -GEOSCOUT--PHOTO-GEOLOCATION-WITH-RESIDUAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS
This project aims to develop a robust model for automatic location detection from Google  Street View images, we created a Residual Neural Network trained to predict the closest city. For image classification problems we decided to experiment with different Residual Network(ResNet) models to train residual blocks to achieve better gradient propagation, which enables training much deeper networks. This approach aligns well with our project goals by providing greater flexibility and robustness. Previous research in this area has shown that ResNet models have outperformed VGG in terms of feature extraction. The advantage of using ResNet is that it can alleviate the problem of vanishing gradients in a neural network. The final architecture, is a ResNet-18 model with 11,689,512 parameters. We also experimented with ResNet-34, incorporating dropout and freezing layers, however, they resulted in low validation, training accuracy, or overfitting. ResNet-18 demonstrated superior generalization on our dataset. Its smaller number of parameters reduces the risk of overfitting, making it less likely to memorize the training data and more likely to perform well on unseen data
